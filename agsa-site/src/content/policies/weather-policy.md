Weather and field safety decisions are made conservatively to protect players.

- League leadership evaluates forecast, radar, and field conditions.
- Final game status is communicated through schedule updates and social channels.
- Lightning or unsafe field conditions result in delay, suspension, or cancellation.
- Makeup scheduling is coordinated by division and field availability.

If you are unsure whether a game is on, check `/schedule` first.
