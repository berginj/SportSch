Player safety comes first. AGSA follows current youth sports safety guidance for practice and game activity.

- Remove athletes from play when concussion symptoms are observed.
- Do not return athletes to play the same day if concussion is suspected.
- Require medical clearance for return-to-play steps when applicable.
- Coaches and families should communicate early about injuries and restrictions.

Use `/contact` for safety questions and escalation.
