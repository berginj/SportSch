AGSA uses a simple operations model so families know where to go for help.

- Registration questions route to the registration contact.
- Schedule concerns route to scheduling contacts.
- Coaching and player development concerns route to coaching leadership.
- Partnership and funding requests route to sponsorship contacts.

Use the category-based form on `/contact` so requests are routed quickly.  
Typical response time is **24-48 hours**.
